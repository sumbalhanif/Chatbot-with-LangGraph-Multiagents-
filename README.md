# Chatbot-with-LangGraph-Multiagents-
I have built a chatbot using Langraph that implements a multi-agent system, which can integrate external tools like Wikipedia and ArXiv. If the chatbot (LLM) cannot find an answer to a query, it searches these external tools to respond. I have used Groq API and the Gemma model in the LLM.
